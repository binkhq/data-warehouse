Description:
    Rewrite of the LL table lc_joins_links_snapshot and lc_joins_links containing both snapshot and daily absolute data of all link and join journeys split by merchant.
Notes:
    This code can be made more efficient if the start is pushed to the trans__lbg_user code and that can be the source for the majority of the dashboards including user_loyalty_plan_snapshot and user_with_loyalty_cards
Parameters:
    source_object       - trans_trans
                        - stg_metrics__dim_date
